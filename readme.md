## What?

Adds a tab to the Person class to document various contact methods.
Can easily be extended to support all sorts of data. Dropdown to pick method (e.g. phone, email, social media) and a basic text box (255 characters).

Actions:
* If a person's contact info (email, phone, mobile phone) is updated, a contact method is created
* If a contact method is deleted, the info gets removed from the person's details.
  * If possible, it will automatically set the latest known contact information again on the person object for this type of contact method.
  
* If a contact method is created, it does not write this info (e.g. e-mail) back to the person's details.
  * This is because of legacy code which still creates a contact method of info that is being removed from the person's details.
  * This is done because removal is sometimes adding an alternative email address, while the previous info is still valid too.
